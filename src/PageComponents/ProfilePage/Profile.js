                We are proud to announce that the Gogle Green branch has helped
                in achieving a great milestone for the Amazon Forestv. For the
                first time since 1978 the Amazon has grown more trees than trees
                were cut down, a great feat! Projections show that the Amazon
                may be at 70% of the original size in 10 years, compared to the
                45% now.
